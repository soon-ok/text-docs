	3.	Costumes & character — themed looks + accessories, and custom brand costume option
	4.	Approachable vibe — Pixar-like personality, friendly and guest-safe energy
	5.	Professional & reliable — guided operation, clear venue requirements, punctual setup
	6.	Content magnet — designed for photos/reels and guest interaction
	•	Suggested comparison rows (if you do the grid):
	•	Booking speed: Instant calendar vs Inquiry-only
	•	Experience: Show/host/roles vs Stand-there demo
	•	Look & feel: Character + costumes vs Bare robot
	•	Guest interaction: Curated moments vs Awkward/unclear
